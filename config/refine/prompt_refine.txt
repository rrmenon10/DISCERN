You were asked to provide a single-line predicate description for a set of examples (let's call this CLUSTER_1) shown below:

{samples_in_prompt}

You generated the following description: "{description}"

This description satisfied the following examples:

{self_identified}

However, the description also identifies with the following examples (that it should not ideally) (let's call this CLUSTER_2 examples):

{others_not_null_identified}

In other words, the current description explains {pass_rate:.1f}\% examples in CLUSTER_1 and {fail_rate:.1f}\% examples in CLUSTER_2.

Please re-write the description that explain only examples from CLUSTER_1 while excluding examples from CLUSTER_2.

Try to make descriptions simple and general. For example, you could focus on the syntax, topic, writing style, etc.
First, for the failing description above, explain why the description does not accomplish the goal of describing only the examlpes in CLUSTER_1. Output this reasoning as:
Thoughts:
1. The examples in CLUSTER_1 and CLUSTER_2 talk about one common topic: {label}.
2. The examples in CLUSTER_1 emphasize on <CLUSTER_1 description>.
3. Whereas, the examples in CLUSTER_2 emphasize on <CLUSTER_2 description>.
4. The previous description failed because <reason>.
5. The examples in CLUSTER_2 are about "<reason>" which is not present in CLUSTER_1. I will focus on mentioning this reason in the new predicate.
Then output the description so that it explains only examples in CLUSTER_1, using the following format: 
NEW PREDICATE: 
- "<more precise-yet-simple CLUSTER_1 description that highlights difference with CLUSTER_2>"

Note: The new predicate has to be strictly different from the previous one.
Note: Do not mention the words CLUSTER_1 or CLUSTER_2 in your new predicate. It should be part of your thought process however.


Thoughts:
1. The examples in CLUSTER_1 and CLUSTER_2 talk about one common topic: {label}.
